### Coursework

**Class Participation (34%):** Attendance, walkthroughs and pair programming exercises.

**Quizzes (33%):** In-class tests covering in-class lectures, readings and concepts.

**Assignments (33%):** Small projects or presentations demonstrating an understanding of concepts.

#### Late Work

Students are expected to submit work *as directed* and *on time*. Work submitted incorrectly and/or late will earn a zero (0).

Computers, servers and the Internet are notoriously unstable. Technical reasons for late work will not be tolerated. Give yourself enough time to complete assignments to spec and submit them as directed with time to spare.


### Grading

**You earn your grade in this course; I do not ‘give’ grades.**

Final grades are based on the completion of coursework as noted. The grading scale is as follows:

| Min. Points | Grade |
|------------:|-------|
| 97	        | A+    |
| 94	        | A     |
| 90          | A-    |
| 88          | B+    |
| 85          | B     |
| 80          | B-    |
| 78          | C+    |
| 75          | C     |
| 59 or less  | F     |


### Attendance Policy

**Attendance and class participation is required.**

Make sure you sign the attendance sheet before the end of class.

Simply put: Treat this course as a job; I am your boss. You would never tell your employer after the fact why you did not show up to work. If you are going to miss a class be proactive in letting me know (via email).

If you are sick, need a mental health day or have a serious family matter to tend to (i.e. illness/death in the family), there is no excuse for not emailing me *prior to the start of class* to inform me of your absence.

Job interviews, court appearances or university business or religious holidays require 48 hours notice. (No one calls an hour before a job interview to schedule one or becomes religious the night before a holiday.) Students are required, as per university policy, to notify his/her professor of an absence related to a religious holy day (travel excluded) within the first three days of class.

Reasons brought to my attention *after* an absence are considered unexcused unless documentation is provided (i.e. doctor's note, university letter, obituary, etc.) by the start of the next class session.

Students who miss class are responsible catching up on missed material. Do not e-mail me asking what you missed. Check the course web site and ask a fellow classmate. I will not "re-teach" material during office hours.


#### Class Participation

Simply showing up for class will not satisfy your attendance requirement. You are expected to participate and be focused on the work we do in each session. This may be taking notes, following a walkthrough or pair programming.

I keep track of your attendance *and* your participation on the work we do in the classroom. If you are distracted by your gadgets, social media, chats, talking with your partner about things other than the work at hand, etc., I will mark you as 'absent' for the day. *Your focus is important.*

In-class exercises are designed to allow you to apply what you have learned and make mistakes without penalty. You are not always expected to finish these; sometimes one mistake will leave you struggling for longer than desired. This is why I do not grade these exercises. But I will account for your focus and effort which is 30 percent of your grade.

If you finish an exercise ahead of time, use the time to try ideas you come up with. Look at other code examples. Create some of your own. Break code. Practice. Don't sit around.


### Classroom Etiquette

**Laptops, tablets, mobile and all other digital devices are to be turned off and put away prior to class.**

Arrive on time in order to be adequately prepared. If you arrive late or need to leave early, do so in a quiet, respectful manner. You are responsible for any content you miss.

All course notes and examples are posted on GitHub, however students are still required to take notes by hand. This will help you remember and develop a better understanding of concepts. Your notes make a great reference when pairing or coding on your own.

Students are expected to show respect for their instructor and peers. Always give your full attention to anyone speaking in class.

Photographing or recording of lectures is prohibited. (Florida law requires you to have "two-party consent" for recording oral or electronic communication; you do not have my consent.)

**Failure to adhere to these policies may result in your dismissal from the classroom for the day.**


### Students with Disabilities

Students who require accommodations are asked to register and present documentation from the Office of Disability Services. The Office of Disability Services (ODS) is located in the Academic Resource Center in Whitten University Center (N201).

ODS staff can be reached at 305-284-2374 (voice), 305-284-3401 (TDD), 305-284-1999 (fax) or disabilityservices@miami.edu.

Office hours are 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday.

I am sensitive to personal privacy. If you prefer not to approach me in class with aforementioned documentation, please contact me via e-mail or come by office hours.


### University Honor Code

Students are expected to abide by the University of Miami Honor Code.

The purpose of the Honor Code is to protect the academic integrity of the University by encouraging consistent ethical behavior in assigned coursework.

**Academic dishonesty of any kind, for whatever reason, will not be tolerated.**


#### Web Ethics

Because of the open nature of the Web, there are times where it is acceptable to use the work of others. Web developers share code. However, not everything is free for the taking.

The following actions are not acceptable in this course:

- "hot linking" to files (images, videos, scripts) not hosted on your web server
- making changes to another design and/or code and submitting it as your own work
- using copyrighted material without written consent of the author

Students are expected to create web sites from scratch, by hand.

Use of applications which generate or format web pages using a graphical user interface, such as Adobe Dreamweaver, are forbidden.

Use of open-source software/code (as permitted by the instructor), Creative Commons and/or public domain media requires attribution. Always adhere to the licensing agreements provided and give credit to the original author of the work, regardless of whether it is a requirement.

Students caught doing any of the above will be considered guilty of cheating and/or plagiarism.

If similar creative elements and/or source code appears in the work of multiple students, all will be penalized.

If you have any doubts about whether you are adhering to web ethics, please do not hesitate to ask your professor.


#### On Plagiarism

No honest student wants to be guilty of the intellectual crime of plagiarism, even unintentionally. Therefore, we provide you with these guidelines so that you don't accidentally fall into the plagiarism trap.

Plagiarism is the taking of someone else's words, work or ideas, and passing them off as a product of your own efforts. Plagiarism may occur when a person fails to place quotation marks around someone else's exact words, directly rephrasing or paraphrasing someone else's words while still following the general form of the original, and/or failing to issue the proper citation to one's source material.

In student papers, plagiarism is often due to:

- turning in someone else's paper as one's own
- using another person's data or ideas without acknowledgment
- failing to cite a source (printed or Internet) of information you used to collect data or ideas
- copying an author's exact words and putting them in the paper without quotation marks
- rephrasing an author's words and failing to cite the source
- copying, rephrasing, or quoting an author's exact words and citing a source other than where the material was obtained (For example, using a secondary source which cites the original material, but citing only the primary material. This misrepresents the nature of the scholarship involved in creating the paper. If you have not read an original publication, do not cite it in your references as if you have!)
- using wording that is very similar to that of the original source, but passing it off as one's own
- The last item is probably the most common problem in student writing. It is still plagiarism if the student uses an author's key phrases or sentences in a way that implies they are his/her own, even if he/she cites the source.

Simply put: DO. NOT. PLAGIARIZE.


### Penalties

**The penalty for academic dishonesty, plagiarism or lapses in web ethics will result in a zero (0) on the assignment submitted, PLUS a 15-point penalty on your final grade and referral to the Honor Council.**


### Student Acknowledgment

Please print, sign and return the [student acknowledgment form](https://github.com/umiami-front-end/course-info/raw/master/student-acknowledgement.pdf) to Prof. Brown no later than one class session following the drop-add date. Please note on the form if you will be missing any class(es) due to a religious holy day.

# CIM 439/639: Front-End Fundamentals
## Syllabus (Spring 2020)

**UPDATE: March 18, 2020**

Because of the university's shift to online learning, the syllabus for Front-End Fundamentals (CIM 439/639) has been adjusted. Only sections of the original syllabus which have changed appear here. Otherwise, all policies from the version still apply.



## Procedure

Moving forward, the class will be held asynchronously. I will send an email on Sunday evening detailing which lessons to focus on for the week. Make plans to complete the work by Friday, noon.

All material for the rest of the semester will be posted, though. You are permitted to work at a faster pace, so long as you meet the requirements for projects and "attendance" listed below.

As was previously established, you are not required to submit any "in-class" exercises. Please check your work against the solutions provided. If you have questions, please reach out via email or schedule an online office hours session.



## Course Materials

For students who are not in South Florida and may not have access their physical textbook, I am working with the [University of Miami Libraries](https://www.library.miami.edu/) to provide digital copies of "Adaptive Web Design" by Aaron Gustafsson and "Javascript for Web Designers" by Mat Marquis.

I will send an update via email as to when these are available.


## Professor Availability

If you have questions, let's see if we can answer those via email first.

If you would like me to look over code you are having an issue with, we can look over the code during an online meeting. DO NOT send files or screenshots via email. I DO NOT open attachments as they can be a vector for a computer virus.

I will have online office hours to be conducted via audio [1] and a type of screen sharing. (Atom has a plugin which permits us to remotely pair program!) I am asking students to please schedule their appointments via my You Can Book Me page:

https://umiami-web.youcanbook.me/

Please make sure you have the required software installed before your appointment. I recommend booking two blocks the *first* time we meet online to make sure the setup works properly. Afterward, please only book one slot at a time. If there is time available after your appointment, I'm okay with extending the appointment. But let's make sure everyone who may need time gets an opportunity.

[1] Why not video? Video is very bandwidth intensive. Not everyone will have a great connection, and we don't know how bogged down networks may become over the next few weeks with so many people working from home! :)


## Coursework

**Class Participation (34 percent)**

- Weekly check-in by Friday at Noon.

In lieu of attending class, I am going to ask for a weekly check-in. This is in place because not all students may be familiar with working online. By having a check-in, I hope it will keep students on task and able to complete the projects.

I apologize if this seems juvenile. That is *not* the intent. Think of this as just being in communication with a boss at work. You cannot just disappear. :) We all need to keep a schedule (especially me in order to schedule online office hours), and this way allows us to be proactive if you run into any issues with the material.

What is expected from a check-in? *An email. That's it.* Use the opportunity to ask questions, ask for help (we can arrange a one-on-one meeting), or just to say you had no problem with the material. You may send the email at *any* time during the week. (Say you do cover the notes, reading and exercise Monday and have no issues, it's perfectly fine to check-in then!)

When I send the weekly email with details of what material is to be covered each week, I will provide a check-in reminder. For consistency sake, let's make it Friday at Noon -- just like all the assignments.

As for how this grade will be calculated, I will use the number of classes we would have met this semester as the basis for per class points. Missing a check-in will be the equivalent of one unexcused absence. (So, if we had 15 class meetings and you missed a check in ... 34 points / 15 classes = 2.27 point deduction).


**Quizzes**

These will be conducted via Blackboard. They will have a *strict* time limit. These can be taken at any time during the week up until the set deadline. (This is how tests worked in my masters program.) Again, for consistency sake, we'll make the deadlines Friday at Noon.

While it is theoretically possible to look up answers as you take the test, this is ill advised. The time spent searching will limit the time you have to enter answers and you probably will not finish the test. My recommendation is to study right before you take the test, then focus on the test. You may have enough time to check on 1-2 answers, but I have no problem with that.

Please be aware, you are still bound by the University Honor Code. You MAY NOT take the test concurrently with other students or share answers. Cheating will not be tolerated.

*You are on your honor.*


**Remaining Projects (33 percent)**

- Responsive Project is still due Wednesday, March 25 at Noon. Please follow the rubric which has already been provided.

- The JavaScript Project will be due Monday, May 4 at Noon. While this can encompass everything learned this semester, it is not necessarily a "final project". A full rubric will be provided at a later date.


## Extra Credit

I *never* give extra credit projects ... so you may want to take advantage of this opportunity. I think it is important to concentrate on JavaScript for the remainder of the semester, which means the SVG lesson gets sacrificed. It's still a valuable thing to know, though.

If you plan to take the Advanced/Interactive Data Visualization course, I strongly recommend doing this lesson/exercise/project. It will give you an understanding as to how SVG works (and give you a little more practice with code).

I will apply the points earned to whatever segment of your grade which needs it. For instance, if you earn five (5) points from the SVG project and you have a low grade on a quiz, I will use the points to boost that segment of your grade.
